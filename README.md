# Licode

An Open Source WebRTC Communications Platform.

With Licode you can host your own WebRTC conference provider and build applications on top of it with easy to use APIs: [client-side](http://licode.readthedocs.io/en/master/client_api/) and [server-side](http://licode.readthedocs.io/en/master/server_api/).

You have two options to start using Licode:

* If you want a quick taste of what Licode can do or you are familiar with [Docker](http://www.docker.com) - [How to use the docker image or build your own](http://licode.readthedocs.io/en/master/docker/)

* If you are interested in contributing, want to get a better view of the Licode architecture or you don't trust those fancy containers - [How to build Licode from source](http://licode.readthedocs.io/en/master/from_source/)

## Community Forums
